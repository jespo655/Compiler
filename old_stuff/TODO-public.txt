* Here-strings (lexer)

Syntax:
    #string here this is part of the string here

Output:
    Token t
    t.type = Token_type::STRING
    t.token = "this is part of the string"




* Errors

Test compiling incorrect code and come up with good error messages that describes what you did wrong




* Utf-8 cleanup (lexer)

Find a cleaner way to read utf-8 characters. Allow utf-8 characters in identifiers as well (but not symbols).
How do we separate symbols from generic utf-8 characters?




* Prefix operators (parser)

As a part of read_evaluated_value and read_evaluated_variable, first check for prefix operators.
