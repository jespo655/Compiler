using.h
    decide exact syntax and usage, before implementing the class


implement ev_values and ev_variables:
    cast
    array_lookup



add functions that gets the type from a vector<Evaluated_value> and vector<Evaluated_variable>
    the only special case is function_call, which can return a list of type
