# Compiler

A compiler project, heavily inspired by [JAI](https://github.com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md).

The primary goal with the project is educational - I want to learn how compilers function. If JAI gets popular I could see the project evolve into a fully functional JAI compiler sometime in the future, but until then I'm happy with experimenting and coming up with my own syntax where I think it fits.
